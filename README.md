Tech-Track: CS307 Group 27

Problem Statement:
As students enter the Purdue Computer Science program, many begin coursework with limited or no prior experience. Therefore, students often have little knowledge about what concentrations or research areas they would like to explore. As a solution, we will develop a web-based game that will introduce students to problems from a variety of courses and computer science topics. Currently, there are limited resources to explore course content, therefore, this game will be a unique and visual solution. 

Project Objectives: 
Develop a web-based game that explores current Purdue Computer Science course topics. 
Add mini-game levels for the user to complete. These games will use topics in Computer Science courses and help the user learn and practice skills covered in those courses. 
Implement a database to track the user’s progress and their ratings for each course level they complete.
Provide an analysis and recommendation for which Computer Science track might interest the user the most based on their success in the mini-games and the ratings they provided.  

Stakeholders:
Users/Customers: Our users and customers will be advisors, professors, and current or prospective Purdue Computer Science majors and minors.
Project Owners: Our team will be the Project Owners for this project.
Software Developers: The members of our team will be the software developers for this project.
Development Managers: The Project Coordinators (GTA’s and TA’s) working with us in this course are the Development Managers.

Deliverables:
A web-based game that will allow Purdue students to explore common concepts from various coursework in the computer science department.
A database that tracks user information and game session data.
